  description: `Analyze note connections and relationships in your Obsidian vault.

Key capabilities:
- Find all notes linked to/from a specific note
- Analyze backlinks and forward links
- Discover orphaned notes (no connections)
- Find highly connected hub notes
- Trace connection paths between notes
- Analyze tag relationships and co-occurrences
- Generate connection statistics and metrics

Perfect for understanding your knowledge graph structure, finding related content, and optimizing note organization.
Helps identify knowledge gaps, content clusters, and navigation patterns.`,
